# Cement Compression Strength Prediction using hypertunning Random Forest Regression


## This repository contains the code and models for predicting the compression strength of cement using Random Forest Regression. The predictive model has been fine-tuned using Grid Cross-Validation Hyperparameter Tuning to achieve optimal performance.The project is deployed on Heroku, allowing for seamless access to the prediction model. 



##  I have used the following libraries for project implementation
  - RandomForestRegression + GridCv: Model implementation
  - Flask: Frontend implementation
  - Heroku: Deployment

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
  git clone (https://github.com/data-pioneer/Cement-Strength-Predictor.git)

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
  pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
1. Run the main file by executing:
python app.py


2. The Url of app will be written on terminal, copy that url in browser.
- Now you can calculate the compression strength of cement.
